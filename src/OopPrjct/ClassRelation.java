Types of relationship between classes:

There are two types of relationship: 1). Inheritance (it is called IS-A, relationship)
                                       2). Association (it is called HAS-A relationship).

                           Association further can divide in two parts:
                           q). Aggregation
                           b). Composition

    Advantages of relationship:
    1). code re-usability
    2). cost-cutting
    3). reduce redundancy

    Association (HAS-A)

    Example:

    class Engine
    {

    }
    class Car
    {
      Engine en = new Engine(); // if wer make a new object inside other class, we can say they are
      making association.
    }

    The main advantage of this association is that both classes are not tighlty held with each other.
    So, there will not face any problem like Inheritance. We can choose some properties from one clas to another.


    From association:

    If there is a week relationship between two classes, then it is called aggregation
    if there is a strong relationship between two classes, then it is called Composition.
